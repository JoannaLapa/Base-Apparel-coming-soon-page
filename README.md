## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

I practiced the most CSS GRID layout and javascript.
### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue focusing on javascript. My future plan is REACT.
### Useful resources

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15314407/how-to-add-button-inside-input - This helped me to arrange the input and the button side by side.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Grid Layout rules. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
